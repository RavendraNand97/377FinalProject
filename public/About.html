                The purpose of our application is to enable prospective Prince 
                Georges residence to view the density of crime that would occur 
                near by to a street they would potentially be moving to. More 
                importantly this application can be used to help inform 
                University of Maryland students on where they should consider 
                living. As a college student the related crime of an area can 
                easily be overlooked when considering the cost of living and how 
                close you would be to campus. Our application makes use of the 
                Prince Georges county crime dataset by creating a map visualization 
                that would allow users to select what types of crimes they would 
                be most concerned about in the area and placing markers of those 
                crimes onto our map provided by leaflet. Markers are placed on the 
                map by clicking the desired checkbox next to the crime name. The 
                map allows users to zoom in and out of and drag the map to find 
                the street or route they would be interested in viewing to get a 
                closer look of the crimes. By clicking on the map markers, you 
                will also be able to view the type of crime if you have selected 
                more than one. With creating crime markers for our application 
                users will have the knowledge to make an informed decision if 
                they would want to avoid an area. 
                If users chose to live in a crime filled area our application 
                also makes use of Prince Georgeâ€™s county police and hospital 
                dataset, which would enable users to identify which police 
                station or hospital is closes in case of any safety or health 
                concerns need to be addressed.
